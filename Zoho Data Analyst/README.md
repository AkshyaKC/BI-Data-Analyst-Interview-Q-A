Zoho Data Analyst question’s right approach that I missed ( CTC= 21 LPA )

Top companies value clarity and structure in responses. Vague answers won’t impress recruiters, but a well-structured approach showcases problem-solving skills and confidence, boosting your chances of success.

Here are the 3 questions that were asked in my interview at Zoho.

1️⃣ How do you detect and handle duplicate records in SQL?

Approach:

1/ 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐝 𝐃𝐮𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬 – Use GROUP BY + HAVING COUNT(*) > 1.
 2/ 𝐆𝐞𝐭 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐬 – Use SELECT DISTINCT.
 3/ 𝐑𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐃𝐮𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬 – Use DELETE with ROW_NUMBER() or CTE.
 4/ 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐃𝐮𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬 – Use PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE INDEX.

Answer:

To detect duplicates, I group data using relevant columns and apply HAVING COUNT(*) > 1. If necessary, I use DISTINCT to retrieve unique records. For cleanup, I leverage ROW_NUMBER() within a CTE to retain only one instance of each duplicate entry. Additionally, I implement constraints to prevent future duplicates.

2️⃣ How do you improve the performance of an SQL query involving large datasets?

Approach:

1/ 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐱 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 – Index frequently filtered & joined columns.
 2/ 𝐀𝐯𝐨𝐢𝐝 𝐒𝐄𝐋𝐄𝐂𝐓 * – Fetch only required columns.
 3/ 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 – Use table partitioning for faster queries.
 4/ 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐞 𝐉𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐬 – Prefer INNER JOIN over OUTER JOIN.
 5/ 𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 – Leverage materialized views for precomputed results.

Answer:

For large datasets, I improve performance by indexing relevant columns and selecting only required fields instead of SELECT *. I also use table partitioning to optimize data retrieval and ensure efficient joins. Additionally, I analyze query execution plans to identify bottlenecks and leverage caching or materialized views where necessary.

3️⃣ How do you analyze user behavior to improve business decisions?

Approach:

1/ 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐬 – Track retention, churn, and feature adoption.
 2/ 𝐂𝐨𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 – Analyze user behavior over time.
 3/ 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐥 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 – Find drop-off points in conversion.
 4/ 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐞𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 – Group users by demographics & behavior.
 5/ 𝐀/𝐁 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 – Experiment to improve engagement.

Answer:

To analyze user behavior, I first define key success metrics like retention and conversion rates. I conduct cohort analysis to study user trends over time and use funnel analysis to detect drop-off points. 
Additionally, I segment users based on engagement levels and perform A/B testing to validate which strategies drive better business decisions.
