OpenAI Data Scientist Interview Experience:


1. Technical Expertise
 • Python & Data Manipulation:
 • How would you enhance the performance of a pandas DataFrame operation with millions of rows?
 • Create a Python function to implement k-means clustering from scratch.
 • Machine Learning:
 • Compare XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest. When would you prefer one over the others?
 • What techniques would you use to address class imbalance in a dataset?
 • Deep Learning:
 • Define transfer learning and explain how you would apply it in practice.
 • What is the vanishing gradient problem, and how does it affect neural network training?
 • Statistics & Probability:
 • How would you test if two distributions are significantly different?
 • Derive the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for a normal distribution.
 • SQL/Data Querying:
 • Write a query to identify the top 5 most frequent categories in a dataset with millions of rows.
 • Explain the concept of window functions and provide an example.

2. Scenario-Based Challenges
 • How would you design an A/B testing framework for a new feature rollout?
 • What steps would you take to reduce dimensionality in a high-dimensional dataset?
 • Share an example of a real-world machine learning project you deployed and the obstacles you encountered.

3. System Design for Data Science
 • Outline the design of a recommendation system for an AI-driven product, including data collection, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.
 • How would you build a real-time anomaly detection system to monitor API calls in a production environment?

4. Behavioral Insights
 • Share a time when you explained a complex data science concept to a non-technical audience.
 • Describe how you handled a situation where a deployed model underperformed.

5. AI/ML-Specific Knowledge
 • How would you fine-tune a large language model like GPT-4 for a specific domain?
 • Discuss the trade-offs between model size and latency in AI systems deployed in production.
