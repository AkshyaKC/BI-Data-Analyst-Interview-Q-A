1. Explain the difference between Import and Direct Query modes. Which would you choose for large datasets? (Direct Query enables real-time data but may be slower, whereas Import is faster but static.)

2. What are slicers, and how do they differ from visual-level filters? Discuss their impact on data in a Power BI dashboard.

3. How do you implement Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI? Explain how you would restrict data access to specific users or groups.

4. What is a paginated report, and when would you use it? These are ideal for multi-page outputs like invoices or billing statements.
